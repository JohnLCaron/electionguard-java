# ðŸ—³ ElectionGuard Input Validation
_last changed: Mar 2, 2022_

The election manifest and each input plaintext ballot are expected to be validated before being passed to the 
electionguard library. Both the encrypted and decrypted tallies may also be validated against the manifest,
and against each other for consistency. This document summarizes the expected (non-crypto) validations.

A specific validation is referenced as, eg, Manifest.B.5 and Ballot.A.2.1

## Manifest

### A. Referential integrity

1. Referential integrity of BallotStyle's geopolitical_unit_ids.
    * For each BallotStyle, all geopolitical_unit_ids reference a GeopoliticalUnit in Manifest.geopolitical_units

2. Referential integrity of Candidate party_id.
    * For each Candidate, the party_id references a Party in Manifest.parties
    
3. Referential integrity of ContestDescription electoral_district_id.
    * For each ContestDescription, the electoral_district_id references a GeopoliticalUnit in Manifest.geopolitical_units    

4. Referential integrity of SelectionDescription candidate_id.
    * For each SelectionDescription, the candidate_id references a Candidate in Manifest.candidates    
    
### B. Duplication

1. All ContestDescription have a unique object_id.   

2. All ContestDescription have a unique sequence_order.  

3. Within a ContestDescription, all SelectionDescription have a unique object_id.

4. Within a ContestDescription, all SelectionDescription have a unique sequence_order.

5. Within a ContestDescription, all SelectionDescription have a unique candidate_id.

6. All SelectionDescription have a unique object_id within the election (see get_shares_for_selection in decryption_share)

### C. Contest VoteVariationType

1. A ContestDescription has VoteVariationType = n_of_m, one_of_m, or approval.

2. For all contests, votes_allowed == number_elected.

3. A one_of_m contest has votes_allowed == 1.

4. A n_of_m contest has 0 < votes_allowed <= number of selections in the contest. 

5. An approval contest has votes_allowed == number of selections in the contest.

## Input Ballot

### A. Referential integrity

1. A PlaintextBallot's style_id must match a BallotStyle object_id in Manifest.ballot_styles.

2. For each PlaintextBallotContest on the ballot, the contest_id must match a ContestDescription.object_id in Manifest.contests.
   
   2.1 Within the PlaintextBallotContest and matching ContestDescription, each PlaintextBallotSelection.selection_id must match a SelectionDescription.object_id.
   
### B. Duplication

1. All PlaintextBallotContest have a unique contest_id.   

2. Within a PlaintextBallotContest, all PlaintextBallotSelection have a unique selection_id.

### C. Voting limits

1. All PlaintextBallotSelection must have a vote whose value is 0 or 1.

2. Within a PlaintextBallotContest, the sum of the PlaintextBallotSelection votes must be <= ContestDescription.votes_allowed.


## Ciphertext Tally

### A. Referential integrity

1. For each CiphertextTally.Contest in the tally, the object_id must match a ContestDescription.object_id in Manifest.contests.

   1.1 CiphertextTally.Contest description_hash must match the ContestDescription.crypto_hash.
   
2. Within the CiphertextTally.Contest and matching ContestDescription, each CiphertextTally.Selection.object_id must match a SelectionDescription.object_id.
   
   2.1 CiphertextTally.Selection description_hash must match the SelectionDescription.crypto_hash.

### B. Duplication

1. All CiphertextTally.Contest must have a unique contest_id. In the contests map, the key must match the value.object_id.  

2. Within a CiphertextTally.Contest, all CiphertextTally.Selection have a unique object_id. In the selections map, the key must match the value.object_id.


## Plaintext Tally

### A. Referential integrity with Manifest

1. For each PlaintextTally.Contest in the tally, the object_id must match a ContestDescription.object_id in Manifest.contests.
   
2. Within the PlaintextTally.Contest and matching ContestDescription, each PlaintextTally.Selection.object_id must match a SelectionDescription.object_id.

### B. Referential integrity with Ciphertext Tally

1. For each PlaintextTally.Contest in the tally, the object_id must match a CiphertextTally.Contest.object_id.
   
2. Within the PlaintextTally.Contest and matching CiphertextTally.Contest, each PlaintextTally.Selection.object_id must match a CiphertextTally.Selection.object_id.

  2.1 The PlaintextTally.Selection.message must match the CiphertextTally.Selection.message.
   
### C. Duplication

1. All PlaintextTally.Contest must have a unique contest_id. In the contests map, the key must match the value.object_id.  

2. Within a PlaintextTally.Contest, all PlaintextTally.Selection have a unique object_id. In the selections map, the key must match the value.object_id.

### D. Shares

1. All Selection shares have an object_id matching the Selection object_id.

2. Within a selection, the selection shares have a unique guardian_id. 

3 There are _nguardian_ shares.

### E. Recovered Shares

1. For each CiphertextDecryptionSelection share with recovered_parts, each recovered_part has an object_id matching the share object_id.

2. Each recovered_part has a unique guardian_id, matching the key in the share's map. 

3. There are _navailable_ recovered_parts. Note that navailable may be greater than quorum.

4. Each recovered_part has a missing_guardian_id matching the share's guardian_id
