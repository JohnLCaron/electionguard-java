# ðŸ—³ ElectionGuard Java 

## RunElectionWorkflow

The _com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.RunElectionWorkflow_ command line utility simulates an
entire ElectionGuard workflow, calling each of the workflow programs in turn. It is used for testing,
it cannot be used in an actual election.

It generates random Guardians, and random ballots, encrypts them, then decrypts the election record and 
publishes the final record.

````
Usage: java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar 
      com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.RunElectionWorkflow [options]
  Options:
  * -in
      Directory containing input election description
    --proto
      Input election record is in proto format
      Default: false
  * -nguardians
      Number of quardians to create
      Default: 6
  * -quorum
      Number of quardians that make a quorum
      Default: 5
  * -encryptDir
      Directory containing ballot encryption
  * -nballots
      number of ballots to generate
      Default: 0
  * -out
      Directory where complete election record is published
    -h, --help
      Display this help and exit
````

The input directory containing the election description is required. It is in Json (default) or Protobuf format. 
If Json, it must contain the file _description.json_. If Protobuf, it must contain the file _electionRecord.proto_, from
which only the election description is read.

You must specify the number of guardians and quorum, and the Guardian's polynomial coefficients are generated at random.

The _encryptDir_ is the output directory of _PerformKeyCeremony_ and the input directory of _EncryptBallots_.
You should make this separate from the input directory.

The _out_ directory is the output directory of _EncryptBallots_ and the input directory of _DecryptBallots _
and _VerifyElectionRecord_.
You should make this separate from the input and the encryptDir directory.

Example:

````
java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.RunElectionWorkflow \
    -in /data/electionguard/cook_county/metadata \
    -nguardians 6 -quorum 5
    -encryptDir /data/electionguard/publishEncryption
    -nballots 111
    -out /data/electionguard/publishDecryption
````

The program exits with a 0 on success, > 0 on failure.
Typical (successful) output looks like:

## Security Issues

This program is used only for testing the workflow. See notes in the individual workflow programs for details.
