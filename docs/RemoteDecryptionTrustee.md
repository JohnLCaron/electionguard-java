# ðŸ—³ ElectionGuard Java 

## DecryptBallots

The _com.sunya.electionguard.decrypting.DecryptingRemoteTrustee_ command line program instantiates the
same _Remote Guardian_ that was created in the Key Ceremony.

The input Election Record comes from the output of an _EncryptBallots_ or _AccumulateTally_ program.

The output Election Record is complete, and can be input to an __ElectionGuard verifier__.

Usage: java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar 
      com.sunya.electionguard.decrypting.DecryptingRemoteTrustee [options]
  Options:
  * -guardianFile
      location of serialized guardian file
    -port
      This DecryptingRemoteTrustee port

The guardianFile containing the serialized Guardian record generated durring the Key Ceremony is required. 

The port which this DecryptingRemoteTrustee will run on may be assigned, otherwise a random one will be used.

The port which the DecryptingRemote will run on may be assigned, otherwise the default port will be used.

Example:

````
java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar com.sunya.electionguard.decrypting.DecryptingRemoteTrustee \
    -guardianFile /local/secret/place/JohnLCaron-3.protobuf
````

The program exits with a 0 on success, > 0 on failure.
Typical (successful) output looks like:

````
Command java -classpath build/libs/electionguard-java-0.9.1-SNAPSHOT-all.jar com.sunya.electionguard.decrypting.DecryptingRemoteTrustee \ 
    -guardianFile /local/secret/place/JohnLCaron-3.protobuf
