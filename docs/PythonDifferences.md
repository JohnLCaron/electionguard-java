## Differences with Python

1. Optional fields

2. Spoiled plaintext tallies

    * Python: Each spoiled ballot tally is stored inside the election plaintext tally. 
      Java library does not currently have access to those, anticipate PR #305 will fix.
    * Java: Each spoiled ballot tally stored in a separate file in *spoiled_tallies/ballot_<ballot_id>*
      Placeholder selections are removed.

3. Spoiled plaintext ballots

    * Java: Each spoiled ballot stored in a separate file in *spoiled_ballots/ballot_<ballot_id>*
      Placeholder selections are removed.
