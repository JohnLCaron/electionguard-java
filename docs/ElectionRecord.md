# üó≥ ElectionGuard Java 
_last changed: April 4, 2021_

_This document may slightly lag both the electionguard-python and electionguard-java library._

## The Election Record

The **_Election Record_** is the publicly available record of the ElectionGuard process. 
The reference _electionguard-python_ library produces a JSON serialization of the election record. 
The _electionguard-java_ library supports JSON serialization and also protobuf serialization. 
In this document simple Java value classes are used to document the election record objects. 
See the implementing libraries for the language specific API. 

Everything here references the [Election Guard specification](https://www.electionguard.vote/spec/0.95.0/).

### The Election Manifest

Before the election starts, the election officials create an Election Manifest for it, describing all
the candidates, contests, and possible ballots. The manifest model is derived from the 
[Civics Common Standard Data Specification](https://developers.google.com/elections-data/reference/election).

````
/** Helper class for conversion of Manifest description to/from Json, using python's object model and naming. */
class ManifestPojo {
  InternationalizedText name;
  String election_scope_id;
  String type;
  String start_date; // ISO-8601
  String end_date; // ISO-8601
  ContactInformation contact_information;

  List<GeopoliticalUnit> geopolitical_units;
  List<Party> parties;
  List<Candidate> candidates;
  List<ContestDescription> contests;
  List<BallotStyle> ballot_styles;

  class AnnotatedString {
    String annotation;
    String value;
  }

  class BallotStyle extends ElectionObjectBase {
    List<String> geopolitical_unit_ids;
    List<String> party_ids;
    String image_uri;
  }

  class Candidate extends ElectionObjectBase {
    InternationalizedText name;
    String party_id;
    String image_uri;
    Boolean is_write_in;
  }

  class ContestDescription extends ElectionObjectBase {
    String electoral_district_id;
    int sequence_order;
    String vote_variation;
    int number_elected;
    int votes_allowed;
    String name;
    List<SelectionDescription> ballot_selections;
    InternationalizedText ballot_title;
    InternationalizedText ballot_subtitle;
  }

  class ContactInformation {
    List<String> address_line;
    List<AnnotatedString> email;
    List<AnnotatedString> phone;
    String name;
  }

  class ElectionObjectBase {
    String object_id;
  }

  class GeopoliticalUnit extends ElectionObjectBase {
    String name;
    String type;
    ContactInformation contact_information;
  }

  class InternationalizedText {
    List<Language> text;
  }

  class Language {
    String value;
    String language;
  }

  class Party extends ElectionObjectBase {
    InternationalizedText ballot_name;
    String abbreviation;
    String color;
    String logo_uri;
  }

  class SelectionDescription extends ElectionObjectBase {
    String candidate_id;
    int sequence_order;
  }
}

### Key Ceremony

The Key Ceremony takes the manifest as input, as well as the total number of Guardians and the mininum number
of Guardians required for decryption. After a successful key ceremony, it adds the **_ElectionConstants_**, 
**_CiphertextElectionContext_**, and a **_CoefficientValidationSet_** for each Guardian, to the Election Record.

During the Key Ceremony, the Guardian state needed for decryption is also created, but that is private state 
and not part of the election record.

````
  class ElectionConstants {
    BigInteger large_prime; // large prime or p. 
    BigInteger small_prime; // small prime or q. 
    BigInteger cofactor;    // cofactor or r. 
    BigInteger generator;   // generator or g. 
  }
````

````
  class CiphertextElectionContext {
    int number_of_guardians;                 // The number of guardians necessary to generate the key. 
    int quorum;                              // The quorum of guardians necessary to decrypt an election.
    Group.ElementModP elgamal_public_key;    // The joint key (K) in the ElectionGuard Spec. 
    Group.ElementModQ description_hash;      // The Manifest crypto_hash. 
    Group.ElementModQ crypto_base_hash;      // The base hash code (ùëÑ) in the ElectionGuard Spec. 
    Group.ElementModQ crypto_extended_base_hash; // The extended base hash code (ùëÑ') in the ElectionGuard Spec. 
  }
````

````
  class CoefficientValidationSet {
    String owner_id;                           // Guardian object_id. 
    List<ElementModP> coefficient_commitments; // The K_ij of the specification. 
    List<SchnorrProof> coefficient_proofs;     // The proof of knowledge for the coefficient commitments. 
  }

  class SchnorrProof {
    ElementModP public_key; // The commitment K_ij
    ElementModP commitment; // h in the spec 
    ElementModQ challenge;  // c in the spec 
    ElementModQ response;   // u in the spec
  }
````

### Plaintext Ballots

A voter's ballot is converted to a **_PlaintextBallot_** for input to Election Guard:

````
class PlaintextBallotPojo {
  String object_id;
  String style_id;
  List<PlaintextBallotContest> contests;

  class PlaintextBallotContest {
    String object_id;
    List<PlaintextBallotSelection> ballot_selections;
  }

  class PlaintextBallotSelection {
    String object_id;
    int vote;
    boolean is_placeholder_selection;
    String extra_data;
  }
}
````

### Encryption 

During encryption, one or more _PlaintextBallots_ are given to the encryption device, and are
encrypted into **_CiphertextBallots_**. The ballot is then either cast or spoiled, and the CiphertextBallot
is added to the election record as a **_Submitted Ballot_**. The plaintext ballots are not part of the election record, 
but presumably kept safe and secret by the election authorities, for recounts and audits.

````
/** Conversion between SubmittedBallot and Json, using python's object model and naming. */
class SubmittedBallotPojo {
  String object_id;          // The object_id of this specific ballot
  String style_id;           // The object_id of the Manifest.BallotStyle
  ElementModQ manifest_hash; // The manifest cyrpto_hash
  ElementModQ code;
  ElementModQ previous_code; // Previous tracking hash (or seed hash) in the ballot chain
  List<CiphertextBallotContestPojo> contests;
  long timestamp;            // When the ballot encryption is generated, in seconds since the Unix epoch.
  ElementModQ crypto_hash;   // This ballot's cyrpto_hash
  ElementModQ nonce;         // LOOK ignored until Optional serialization gets fixed
  BallotBox.State state;     // CAST or SPOLIED

  class CiphertextBallotContestPojo {
    String object_id;             // The object_id of the Manifest.ContestDescription
    ElementModQ description_hash; // The cyrpto_hash of the Manifest.ContestDescription
    List<CiphertextBallotSelectionPojo> ballot_selections;
    ElementModQ crypto_hash;      
    ElGamalCiphertextPojo ciphertext_accumulation; // encrypted total votes in the contest
    ElementModQ nonce;                    // The nonce used to generate the ciphertext_accumulation
    ConstantChaumPedersenProofPojo proof; // The proof for the encrypted_total
  }

  class CiphertextBallotSelectionPojo {
    String object_id;                   // The object_id of the Manifest.SelectionDescription
    ElementModQ description_hash;       // The cyrpto_hash of the Manifest.SelectionDescription
    ElGamalCiphertextPojo ciphertext;   // encrypted vote count for this selection
    ElementModQ crypto_hash;
    boolean is_placeholder_selection;
    ElementModQ nonce;                  // The nonce used to generate the ciphertext
    DisjunctiveChaumPedersenProofPojo proof; // proof of knowledge that the vote count = 0 or 1
    ElGamalCiphertextPojo extended_data;
  }

  class ConstantChaumPedersenProofPojo {
    ElementModP pad;
    ElementModP data;
    ElementModQ challenge;
    ElementModQ response;
    int constant;
  }

  class DisjunctiveChaumPedersenProofPojo {
    ElementModP proof_zero_pad;
    ElementModP proof_zero_data;
    ElementModP proof_one_pad;
    ElementModP proof_one_data;
    ElementModQ proof_zero_challenge;
    ElementModQ proof_one_challenge;
    ElementModQ challenge;
    ElementModQ proof_zero_response;
    ElementModQ proof_one_response;
  }

  class ElGamalCiphertextPojo {
    ElementModP pad;
    ElementModP data;
  }
}
````

The encrypting device information is also added to the election record:

````
  class EncryptionDevice {
    long uuid;          // Unique identifier for device. 
    String session_id;  // Used to identify session and protect the timestamp. 
    int launch_code;    // Election initialization value. 
    String location;    // Arbitrary string to designate the location of the device. 
}
````

### Tally Accumulation 

During Tally Accumulation, the Encrypted Ballots are added together in a way that does not
require the ballots to be decrypted first. The result is an **_EncryptedTally_**, which is then added to the
election record:

````
/** Conversion between CiphertextTally and Json, using python's object model and naming. */
class CiphertextTallyPojo {
  String object_id;                     // arbitrary string to describe this tally
  Map<String, CiphertextTallyContestPojo> contests;

  class CiphertextTallyContestPojo {
    String object_id;                   // The Manifest ContestDescription object_id
    Group.ElementModQ description_hash; // The Manifest ContestDescription crypto_hash
    Map<String, CiphertextTallySelectionPojo> selections;
  }

  class CiphertextTallySelectionPojo {
    String object_id;                   // The Manifest SelectionDescription object_id
    Group.ElementModQ description_hash; // The Manifest SelectionDescription crypto_hash
    ElGamal.Ciphertext ciphertext;      // accumulated vote for this selection
  }
````

### Tally Decryption 

During Tally Decryption, the _EncryptedTally_ is decrypted into a **_PlaintextTally_** by a quorum number of Guardians. 
This is the count of the election results for whatever set of ballots were accumulated in the election record.
The PlaintextTally as well as the list of **_AvailableGuardians_** are added to the election record:

````
/** Conversion between PlaintextTally and Json, using python's object model and naming. */
class PlaintextTallyPojo {
  String object_id;             // matches CiphertextTally object_id
  Map<String, PlaintextTallyContestPojo> contests; // keyed by Contest object_id

  class PlaintextTallyContestPojo {
    String object_id;           // The Manifest ContestDescription object_id
    Map<String, PlaintextTallySelectionPojo> selections; // keyed by Selection object_id
  }

  class PlaintextTallySelectionPojo {
    String object_id;           // The Manifest SelectionDescription object_id
    Integer tally;              // The vote for this selection
    Group.ElementModP value;    // g^tally or M in the spec
    ElGamal.Ciphertext message; // The encrypted vote count
    List<CiphertextDecryptionSelectionPojo> shares; // Guardians' shares of the decryption, keyed by guardian_id.
  }

  class CiphertextDecryptionSelectionPojo {
    String object_id;               // The Manifest SelectionDescription object_id
    String guardian_id;             // The Guardian that this share belongs to
    Group.ElementModP share;        // The Share of the decryption of a selection. `M_i` in the spec.
    ChaumPedersenProofPojo proof;   // For available guartdians, proof that the share was decrypted correctly.
    Map<String, CiphertextCompensatedDecryptionSelectionPojo> recovered_parts; // For missing guardians, keyed by available guardian_id.
  }

  class CiphertextCompensatedDecryptionSelectionPojo {
    String object_id;
    String guardian_id;             // available Guardian that this share belongs to
    String missing_guardian_id;     // missing Guardian for whom this share is calculated on behalf of
    Group.ElementModP share;        // share of the decryption of a selection. M_il in the spe
    Group.ElementModP recovery_key; // available guardian's share of the missing_guardian's public key.
    ChaumPedersenProofPojo proof;   // proof that the share was decrypted correctly
  }

  class ChaumPedersenProofPojo {
    Group.ElementModP pad;
    Group.ElementModP data;
    Group.ElementModQ challenge;
    Group.ElementModQ response;
  }
````

````
class AvailableGuardian {
  String guardian_id;   // The guardian id. 
  int x_coordinate;     // The guardian x coordinate value, aka sequence_order. 
  Group.ElementModQ lagrangeCoordinate; // Its lagrange coordinate when decrypting. 
}
````

### Spoiled Ballot Decryption

During this step, which may be done at the same time as the Tally Decryption, the Encrypted Ballots that were marked
as spoiled (but not the cast ballots!) are decrypted by a quorum number of Guardians. For each spoiled SubmittedBallot,
a PlaintextBallot and a PlaintextTally (that is just for that one spoiled SubmittedBallot) are produced. These are added 
to the Election Record. These objects are the same as the ones already documented.

### Election Validation

The entire Election Record may be submitted to an ElectionGuard Validator, which uses just the Election Record
to validate with all the checks that are in the [Validator specification](https://www.electionguard.vote/spec/0.95.0/9_Verifier_construction/);

The complete set of objects looks like:

````
  class ElectionRecord {
    Manifest election;
  
    // KeyCeremony
    ElectionConstants constants;
    CiphertextElectionContext context;
    List<CoefficientValidationSet> guardianCoefficients;
  
    // Encyption
    List<EncryptionDevice> devices; 
    List<SubmittedBallot> acceptedBallots; // All ballots, cast and spoiled
  
    // Tally Accumulation
    CiphertextTally encryptedTally;
  
    // Decryption
    PlaintextTally decryptedTally;
    List<PlaintextBallot> spoiledBallots; 
    List<PlaintextTally> spoiledTallies; 
    List<AvailableGuardian> availableGuardians; 
  }
````
