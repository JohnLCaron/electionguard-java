# ðŸ—³ ElectionGuard Java 

## Perform Key Ceremony

The _com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.PerformKeyCeremony_ command line utility simulates
the creation of the election Guardians by performing a 
[key ceremony](https://www.electionguard.vote/spec/0.95.0/4_Key_generation/). 

The output is a set of serialized Guardians that are used in the _DecryptBallots_ workflow, along with the first
pieces of the Election Record: the election description, election context, and Guardians' coefficient validations.

````
Usage: java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar 
      com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.PerformKeyCeremony [options]
  Options:
  * -in
      Directory containing input election description
  * -out
      Directory where Guardians and election context are written
    -coefficients
      CoefficientsProvider classname
    -nguardians
      Number of quardians to create (required if no coefficients)
      Default: 0
    -quorum
      Number of quardians that make a quorum (required if no coefficients)
      Default: 0
    -h, --help
      Display this help and exit
````

The input directory containing the election description is required. It can be in Json or Protobuf format. 
If Json, it must contain the file _description.json_. If Protobuf, it must contain the file _electionRecord.proto_, from
which only the election description is read.

Either a _CoefficientsProvider_ is provided (see below), or the number of guardians and quorum is provided. 
In the latter case, the Guardians' polynomial coefficients are generated at random.

The output directory where the Election Record is written is required. The first pieces of the record are
written: the election description, election context, and Guardians' coefficient validations.
The Guardians are written to that directory into the file _private/guardians.proto_.

Example:

````
java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.PerformKeyCeremony \
    -in /data/electionguard/cook_county/metadata \
    -out /data/electionguard/keyceremony \
    -nguardians 6 -quorum 5
````

The program exits with a 0 on success, > 0 on failure.
Typical (successful) output looks like:

````
KeyCeremony read election description from directory /data/electionguard/cook_county/metadata
  write Guardians to directory /data/electionguard/keyceremony
  generate random Guardian coefficients
  Create 6 Guardians, quorum = 5

Key Ceremony
 Confirm all guardians have shared their public keys
 Execute the key exchange between guardians
 Confirm all guardians have shared their partial key backups
 Confirm all guardians truthfully executed the ceremony
 Confirm all guardians have submitted a verification of the backups of all other guardians
 Confirm all guardians have verified the backups of all other guardians
 Create the Joint Election Key
*** KeyCeremony SUCCESS
````

### CoefficentsProvider

Users can supply their own java class that implements _com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.CoefficentsProvider_,
which supplies the Guardians' polynomial coefficients. 
To do so, place a jar containing that class on the classpath. Example:

````
java -classpath electionguard-java-all.jar,my.jar com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.PerformKeyCeremony \
    -in /data/electionguard/cook_county/metadata \
    -out /data/electionguard/keyceremony \
    -coefficients my.package.MyCoefficentsProvider
````

The class _com.sunya.electionguard.workflow.RandomCoefficientsProvider_ is an implementation of CoefficientsProvider
you can use as an example to write your own.

## Security Issues

The output contains the Guardians' secret keys in plaintext, and so the entire key ceremony must be run in
a secure way that is unspecified here. For that reason, this program is just used for testing the workflow.


## Key Ceremony information exchange and messaging rounds. #84

With Guardians becoming non-local objects, I am investigating the minimal set of information needed in the rounds of information exchange between Guardians during the key ceremony. I believe this is independent of whether one has a point-to-point exchange or a centralized mediator facilitating the exchange. Im also trying to clarify how many rounds of messaging are needed, and what is needed in each round.

This is my current understanding, in the hopes it will be useful to others, and to get feedback on any misunderstandings:

**Round 1**. Each guardian shares their public keys with all the other guardians. Each guardian validates the other guardian's commitments against their proof.
````
  class PublicKeySet {
    String ownerId(); // guardian object_id
    int guardianXCoordinate(); // guardian x coordinate (aka sequence_order)
    Rsa.PublicKey auxiliaryPublicKey();  // Assume RSA?
    List<SchnorrProof> coefficientProofs();  // The election polynomial coefficients commitments and proofs
 } 
```` 
 Note: Having a pluggable auxilary encryption function adds complexity, can we leave it out for now?
 Note: coefficientProofs contain the coefficient comittments, and the election public key and proof
 
 Question: "An election verifier must confirm (A) and (B) for each guardian $T_i$ and for each $j in Z_k." Should that also be done now by each receiving guardian? "After verifying (A) and (B) for all other trustees, each guardian then..." So Im assuming yes.
 	   
 
 **Round 2**. Each guardian shares partial key backups with each of the other guardians, each guardian verifies their own backups.
```` 
  class ElectionPartialKeyBackup {
    String generatingGuardianId(); 		// Id of the guardian that generated this backup.
    String designatedGuardianId(); 		// Id of the guardian to receive this backup
    int designatedGuardianXCoordinate(); // The x coordinate (aka sequence order) of the designated guardian

    Auxiliary.ByteString encryptedCoordinate(); // The encrypted coordinate of generatingGuardianId polynomial's value at designatedGuardianXCoordinate.
  } 
````  
 Note: coefficient comittments were already sent in the PublicKeySet.
 Note: The response to sending the partial key backup message can be a validation failure, so an extra round is not needed.
   

**Round 3**. For any partial backup verification failures, each challenged guardian broadcasts its response to the challenge.
         The mediator verifies the response. In point to point, each guardian would verify.
```` 
  class ElectionPartialKeyChallengeResponse {
    String generatingGuardianId();
    String designatedGuardianId();
    int designatedGuardianXCoordinate();
    
    Group.ElementModQ coordinate(); // The unencrypted coordinate of generatingGuardianId polynomial's value at designatedGuardianXCoordinate.
  }
````  
 Note: coefficient comittments were already sent in the PublicKeySet. Besides following the rule of minimizing copies of state, it may
   also remove an attack point by not letting the challenged guardian muck around with its commitments?
   
   
   
**Round 4**. All guardians compute and send their joint election public key. If they agree, then the key ceremony is a success.

 Note: Not sure about having the guardians compute the extended base hash, which means they have to have access to the election manifest.
